\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chapter:conclusion}

Chopped symbolic execution is a novel form of symbolic execution which
allows users to specify uninteresting parts of the code which can be
excluded during analysis, thus focusing the exploration on those paths
most relevant to the task at hand.  Our preliminary evaluation shows
that chopped symbolic execution can lead to significant improvements
in scalability for different scenarios such as vulnerability
reproduction and test suite augmentation.  Future work
can explore these scenarios and others in more depth, aim to automate
the identification of functions to skip, and extend the approach with
the ability to skip arbitrary code fragments.
