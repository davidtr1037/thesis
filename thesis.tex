%%  Skeleton LaTeX2e file for the preparation of theses at UofT;
%%  conforms to the School of Graduate Studies' guidelines of 07/97.
%%  To be used in conjunction with class file `ut-thesis.cls', whose
%%  features it illustrates.
%%
%%  To comment out parts of a file, use the macro \ignore{...}
%%  around the entire block of text you want to ignore.
%%
%%  To explicitly set the pagestyle of any inserted blank page when
%%  \cleardoublepage occurs, use one of \clearemptydoublepage or
%%  \clearplaindoublepage instead.
%%
%%  For single-spaced quotes or quotations, use the `longquote' and
%%  `longquotation' environments.  For single-spaced, 1 1/2-spaced,
%%  or double-spaced paragraphs, use one of the environments
%%  `singlespaced', `oneandahalfspaced', or `doublespaced'.  More
%%  generally, for paragraphs with a line spacing of `n', use
%%  `\begin{newspacing}{n}...\end{newspacing}'.

%%%%%%%%%%%%         PREAMBLE         %%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Default settings format a final copy (12pt font, single-sided,
%% double-spaced, normal margins, single-spaced notes).  For a rough
%% copy (10pt font, double-sided, double-spaced, normal margins, with
%% the word "DRAFT" printed at each corner of every page), use the
%% `draft' option.  The default line spacing can be changed with one
%% of the following options: `singlespaced', `oneandahalfspaced', or
%% `doublespaced'.  The notes are always single-spaced by default, but
%% can be made to have the same spacing as the rest of the document by
%% using the option `spacednotes'.  The size of the margins can be
%% changed with one of the following options: `narrowmargins' (1 1/4"
%% left, 3/4" others), `normalmargins' (1 1/4" left, 1" others),
%% `widemargins' (1 1/4" all), `extrawidemargins' (1 1/2" all).  Any
%% other standard option for the `report' document class can be used
%% to override the default or draft settings.

%% The line spacing of the document should be specified using one of

%% This generates the index
\makeindex


\begin{document}


%% This sets the page style and numbering for preliminary sections.
\begin{preliminary}

%% This generates the title page from the information given above.
\maketitle

%% There should be NOTHING between the title page and abstract.

%% Anything placed between the abstract and table of contents will
%% appear on a separate page since the abstract ends with \newpage
%% and the table of contents starts with \clearpage.

\cleardoublepage

%% The `dedication' and `acknowledgements' sections do not create new
%% pages so if you want the two sections to appear on separate pages,
%% you should put an explicit \newpage between them.

%% This generates an "acknowledgements" section, if needed.
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document)

%% This generates the abstract page, with the line spacing adjusted
%% according to SGS guidelines.

\cleardoublepage

%% This generates the Table of Contents (on a separate page).

%%  Put your Chapters here; the easiest way to do this is to keep   %%
%%  each chapter in a separate file and `\include' all the files    %%
%%  right here.  Note that each chapter file should start with the  %%
%%  line "\chapter{ChapterName}".  Note that using `\include'       %%
%%  instead of `\input' makes each chapter start on a new page.     %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% ***   Include chapter files here.   ***
%%
%% Use include only at the top level - makes compilation faster and adds 
%% clearpage before and after every file.
