\subsection{Slice selection}\label{Se:Slicing}

Recall from the overview that ...

More formally, let $MR_{f,l}$ be the intersection of the points-to set
of $l$ with $M^{*}_f$.  Then, we construct the set of all store
instructions in $R_f$ whose points-to sets intersect with $MR_{f,l}$.
This set of store instructions is then the input to a standard
static slicing algorithm which will slice the functions in $R_f$ with
respect to this set (\ie the algorithm will remove any statements from
$R_f$ which are unrelated to these store instructions).
